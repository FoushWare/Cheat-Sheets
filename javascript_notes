Why do people disable javascript?

for security issue cause it's compatible for every engine it's an engine built-in 

and every browser have it's javascript engine .it's not mantained by one company like java 

so it has holes but many website won't work properly if you disable it and some won't work






Methods that deal with strings
    ____________________________________
1-String.substr(startpoint,numberOfCharacterToExtract)==>
this will return the specified string from the start to what you stop
--some cases=>
if the start is nagitive it will start with the end of string 
if the start is nagitive and is greater than the string length this will start from the first char in the string
if the start is positive and is greater than the string length this will return empty string 
---------------------------------------------
2- String.slice(startPoint,endPoint);
cut the string from the startpoint to endPoint not including the endpoint
it's cases is the same as substr() function
---------------------------------------------------

Cheat sheet: JavaScript Array methods
Deriving a new Array from an existing Array:

['■','●','▲'].slice(1, 3)          ⟼ ['●','▲']
['■','●','■'].filter(x => x==='■') ⟼ ['■','■']
    ['▲','●'].map(x => x+x)        ⟼ ['▲▲','●●']
    ['▲','●'].flatMap(x => [x,x])  ⟼ ['▲','▲','●','●']
Computing a summary of an Array:

['■','●','▲'].some(x => x==='●')  ⟼ true
['■','●','▲'].every(x => x==='●') ⟼ false

['■','●','▲'].join('-') ⟼ '■-●-▲'

['■','●'].reduce((result,x) => result+x, '▲')      ⟼ '▲■●'
['■','●'].reduceRight((result,x) => result+x, '▲') ⟼ '▲●■'
Changing all of an Array (the input Array is modified and returned):

['■','●','▲'].fill('●') ⟼ ['●','●','●']
['■','●','▲'].reverse() ⟼ ['▲','●','■']
['■','●','■'].sort()    ⟼ ['■','■','●']
Finding Array elements:

['■','●','■'].includes('■')           ⟼ true
['■','●','■'].indexOf('■')            ⟼ 0
['■','●','■'].lastIndexOf('■')        ⟼ 2
['■','●','■'].find(x => x=/home/foush/Documents/talkybot_backend🤖/talkybot-fe/src/components/BotBuilder/Intents/Faqs/Replies/CreateFaqs/AddReplyDialog.jsx=='■')      ⟼ '■'
['■','●','■'].findIndex(x => x==='■') ⟼ 0
Listing elements (spreading via ... is needed because the methods return iterables):

[...['■','●','▲'].keys()]    ⟼ [0,1,2]
[...['■','●','▲'].values()]  ⟼ ['■','●','▲']
[...['■','●','▲'].entries()] ⟼ [[0,'■'],[1,'●'],[2,'▲']]
Adding or removing an element at either end of an Array:

arr=['■','●'];     arr.push('▲');    arr ⟼ ['■','●','▲']
arr=['■','●','▲']; arr.pop();        arr ⟼ ['■','●']

arr=['■','●'];     arr.unshift('▲'); arr ⟼ ['▲','■','●']
arr=['▲','■','●']; arr.shift();      arr ⟼ ['■','●']
